            1960s and early 1970s in the UK Kingdom and also in the United
            States, origins origins come from the blues rock, hard rock and
            psychedelic rock. Is characterized mainly because of his strong and
            distorted guitars, rhythms emphatic, the sounds of the bass and
            drums are thicker than expected. habitual and the voice is generally
            high-pitched or guttural.

            Doom metal generally uses the same instruments as the other genres
            derived from heavy metal: guitars, bass and drums. More traditional
            bands generally use a single guitarist, who acts as leader and
            rhythm at the same time. The other subgenres use two guitarists to
            give more power to their music, although this is not always the
            case. However, there are many bands (generally the most extreme)
            that intersperse the use of keyboards, as well as symphonic elements
            such as flutes, violins and harps. They are also many bands that add
            sounds generated by synthesizers, lately in the drone/doom bands.
            These, moreover, generally they dispense with the use of drums due
            to their long and dense tempos.

            Thrash metal in general is characterized by the use of tempos
            faster, more aggressive guitar riffs and with a greater use of palm
            mute, quite fast solos but with many notes that escape the tonality,
            giving it a characteristic sound, bass sounds quite pronounced
            inherited from the NWOBHM. Something very special in style is the
            battery where pedal and bass drum alternate speeds above 180 bpm,
            while it is also worth of the double pedal or double bass drum and
            aggressive voices but without reaching the extreme of heavier styles
            like black metal, perhaps the fast and aggressive speed is more
            inherited from hardcore punk without However, thrash acquires more
            technique at the time of execution.

          Traditional Black Metal has musical characteristics well defined: the
          voice is scratchy and sharp, known as shriek, the guitars are fast and
          the riffs are repetitive, whose usual technique is tremolo picking,
          and blast beats are the most used resource in the drums, and the bass
          for its part, is an instrument that passes background and is
          practically inaudible. In this genre, it prioritizes the creation of
          atmospheres in the compositions, over the their technical complexity.
          For this reason, the low quality of production and post-production is
          an important element that the first gangs used and is still in force,
          because, according to Varg Vikernes: 'A production that is too clean
          would fail to convey the feeling of coldness or desolation essential
          in Black Metal'

          Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. Is characterized
          for using guttural voices, guitars with an excessive use of overdrive,
          low tunings for your instruments, fast percussion (with a dominant use
          of the double pedal), complex structures music, as well as unorthodox
          techniques for the composition of the guitar riffs. The theme of death
          metal covers topics such as horror stories, anti-Christianity, serial
          killers, cannibalism, torture, among others. On the other hand, it is
          influenced by the physical and moral problems of man: death,
          warmongering, society, enlightenment, philosophy and others. Typically
          a band of death metal is made up of a vocalist, two guitarists, a
          bassist and a drummer, that is, the standard formation of heavy metal.
